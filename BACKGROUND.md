# Background

This scenario just popped into my head one morning while I was walking to Starbucks. For some reason I couldn’t let go of it.

## My Thoughts

Revisiting the scenes, and exercising his demons from each situation, is the penance he pays for his actions in the past. Each day the itch reminds him that he must continue to work through the current memories or through new ones. The only way to stop the itch from progressing to the pain is to sit in the chair. When he sits, the pain stops and he is presented with a vivid reminder of what he must pay penance for this day.

After time (months? years?) he just wants to die, but the itch won’t let him. If he stops eating and becomes hungry, the itch will force him to eat. Suicide attempts are aborted, with crippling pain if necessary. He wonders if there is an end to the scenes he must replay. Surely he should have run out by now. He begins to suspect that many of the scenes never actually happened to him - even though their presentation is so vivid and intense that at the time he has no choice but to believe they were experiences from his past. And even as he plays through them he seems to remember them. But surely he is not old enough to have lived through so many depressing experiences.

The itch and the pain have no physical basis.

The room becomes the point of departure for each replay. The conditions in the room are horrendous - but that’s all part of the penance - and one of the reasons he wants to die. The itch will not let him open the window, and certainly won’t let him out of the room to open the shutter to relieve the darkness of the room, and of his life. His only way out of the room in to continue to play through the experiences presented to him.

Lot’s of questions to explore:

1. where did the itch come from? Are these experiences all his and he has just forgotten some of them?
2. if they’re not his then whose are they and why does he have to exercise someone else’s demons? How will it all end?
3. How does he eat?
 * Where do his meals come from?
 * Who deliveres the groceries and who prepares his meals?
