# The Chair

The old man sat in the darkened room. The only light was a thin sliver of sun that came in between the edge of the shutter and the outside wall that it could no longer reach.

The old man could tell the approximate time of day by the position of the sun on the threadbare carpet. It was only midmorning, but it was already hot, humid, and oppressive in the room. There was no air conditioner. The furnishings were all damp, and had been for years. Ever since he had closed the one window in the room and, on his last trip outside, closed the outside shutter to keep the outside world away. Or maybe it was to keep him away from the outside world.

He had not chosen to isolate himself in the room; the thought to block the light had come as a compulsion. A compulsion so strong that he had no hope of resisting. And, the next day, the itch had come for the first time.

Ever since that first day, the itch had started every day at this time. Even on cloudy or stormy days when he couldn’t see the sun to judge the time. It started in the man’s left hand, where the bones from his thumb met the bones of his first finger.

The first time he felt the itch, he just scratched it. At his age it seemed like there was always an itch someplace, and he didn’t pay much attention to them. This time, though, it didn’t fade away. It became instead a bit more intense. This had happened before, of course. It was all part of the inevitable death of his body. Each day one more little thing stopped working correctly, or stopped working at all. A persistent itch was certainly not an unusual event.

He scratched again, and the itch began to transition into a hot pain, slight at first, not much more intense than the itch, just a bit more uncomfortable. Maybe if he resisted scratching it would eventually fade. But the itch, and the pain, were persistent. Whether he scratched it or not, its presence began to take over more and more of his awareness. It started to spread and continued to intensify. First to the joints of his fingers, then slowly up his arm to his elbow, and finally to his shoulder.

He knew it wasn’t a heart attack, he had checked the other symptoms as soon as the pain started to creep up his arm. He’d taken an aspirin, just in case. But the pain, preceded by the itch, slowly advanced from his shoulder to his chest. When he could no longer stand it, he sat down, frustrated, in the darkened room, in the old arm chair that faced the now shuttered window.

The itch and the pain ceased as soon as he sat down. It was replaced immediately by a vivid image of  a particular moment from his youth. An image that he had been trying to bury and forget ever since it happened. He knew, somehow, that he needed to relive that moment, the moments leading up to it and the moments immediately after. He didn’t want to; but the same compulsion that had forced him to shutter the one window in the darkened room took over, and he knew he had no choice.
